I. steering lines in remoteMonitoring_NZS_cfg.py 
regarding LS certification:

1. keep all the time 0 for the 
flagtodefinebadchannel = cms.int32(0),

2. you can change #bins for each run, 
but much easy to keep it as 
max #LS over all runs, ~800 :
howmanybinsonplots = cms.int32(800)

3. instead nbadchannels1 = cms.int32(7),...,
new steering lines are added:
  #Verbosity = cms.untracked.int32(-77),
  # to select abnormal events,for which Nbcs > this limits
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HBdepth1 = cms.int32(20),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HBdepth2 = cms.int32(7),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HEdepth1 = cms.int32(16),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HEdepth2 = cms.int32(13),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HEdepth3 = cms.int32(4),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HFdepth1 = cms.int32(10),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HFdepth2 = cms.int32(5),
  lsdep_cut1_peak_HOdepth4 = cms.int32(46),
  #  to select events with Nbcs > this limits
  lsdep_cut3_max_HBdepth1 = cms.int32(19),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HBdepth2 = cms.int32(6),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HEdepth1 = cms.int32(15),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HEdepth2 = cms.int32(12),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HEdepth3 = cms.int32(3),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HFdepth1 = cms.int32(9),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HFdepth2 = cms.int32(4),
  lsdep_cut3_max_HOdepth4 = cms.int32(40),


II. to fill numbers into our table:

(it's important to remember that all dependencies 
are plotted vs continuous("sploshnoj) numbering 
of ls(=iLS), not its real numbers LS)

............................................variable in table:           

1) in zRunLS.C - to be used: 
only 1st page and 
plot 1:  h_nevents_per_eachLS  .........   #ev per iLS
